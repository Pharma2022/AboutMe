                <p class =" paragraph">Shah is the Lead Medicines Information and Formulary Pharmacist at North Middlesex University Hospital. He did his pre-reg at Barts Health NHS Trust, where he remained briefly post-registration. He was on rotaional band 6 program at West Middlesex Hospital. It was there he made an intravenous iron calculator on Microsoft Excel. On completion he then rotated through band 7 at North Middlesex through haematology, care of the elderly and microbiology. He is now the lead for Medicines Information. Shah has a strong interest in web-development and wants to take digital healthcare to the next level. </p>
                
                <p class= "paragraph2"> Shah's introduction to coding began at university where he tried to learn Java but found this was very complex and despite a few attempts even after graduation found that online courses were not helpful as there was not enough material that would help visualise the end product. However, a colleague at work suggested scrimba.com. Within 1 month, Shah had learnt the basics of Javascript, CSS and HTML from scratch. </p>
                
                <p class= "paragraph3"> Within 1 week of completing the course Shah had built the first working prototype of his Intravenous Iron calculator and has over the last couple of months been testing and enhancing its functionality. He has now completed CSS grid and is looking to refactor his CSS to make it DRYyer and more responsive.</p>
